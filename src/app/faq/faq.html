        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What am I buying?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You are buying a 65-Life Whole Life Insurance policy.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is a whole life insurance plan?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          A whole life insurance plan offers protection to your family for the length of time you need it, as long as you pay the premiums. Term insurance only offers protection for a certain time period. Another big difference between whole life and term life insurance is that whole life insurance builds “cash value.”

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What are the coverage amounts?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The coverage amounts are determined by the child’s age, health, and amount of monthly premium. They can range from $50,000 to $200,000.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: How long are premiums paid?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Premiums are paid until the insured is age 65. Northwestern Mutual offers other whole life plans that are payable for a shorter or longer time. If interested, please phrase that means get in touch with FR.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Will premiums ever go up?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The cost is guaranteed to remain the same for the life your policy regardless of your child’s age or health.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is the Additional Purchase Benefit?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The Additional Purchase Benefit enables you to lock in the right to buy insurance based on the child’s health today. More coverage can be purchased near the child’s 22nd, 25th, 28th, 31st, 34th, 37th, and 40th birthdays . Policies can also be purchased earlier when the child gets married or adopts or has a child. You are protecting the child’s ability to purchase additional insurance later in life, no matter what happens to that child’s health.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Is my child required to buy more insurance?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No, it is only an option. They can take advantage of any or all options to buy more coverage. Their last option will be near their 40th birthday.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is Waiver of Premium?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          If your child becomes disabled, Northwestern Mutual would pay the policy premiums and continue to keep the coverage in force. If the child is still disabled when they purchase an additional policy, Northwestern Mutual will waive the premium on the new policy as well.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 9 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Can Northwestern Mutual ever cancel my policy?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No. The policy has a guaranteed death benefit assuming premiums are paid on time.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 10 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is the cash value?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          As you pay premiums on your whole life policy you are building equity over time. This equity is known as the policy’s cash value. Every policy has a guaranteed cash value but the non-guaranteed dividends can increase the cash value faster than the guaranteed amounts.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 11 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is the estimated cash value based on?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          It assumes all premiums are paid annually and any non-guaranteed dividends received purchase additional coverage. Dividends assume no loans as loans may impact dividends. Estimated dividends reflect current claim, expense, and investment experience and are not estimates or guarantees of future results. For these estimates, the dividend factors are assumed to remain level for the life of the policy. However, it is likely that dividends actually paid will be larger or smaller than those assumed.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 12 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Can the cash value ever decrease?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No. In fact it is guaranteed to increase every year. Once the cash value has increased (even if it is more than the guaranteed amount) it can NEVER go down in value.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 13 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Can my child get access to the cash value?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Only the owner can make decisions regarding the policy. After your child is 18, they can become the owner of the policy. If and when you decide to transfer the ownership to your child is up to you.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 14 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Is a medical exam required?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No medical exam is required. Completing the health questions is the first step. In some cases we may request your child’s medical records directly from their doctor or pharmacy.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 15 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: I live in a different state from my grandchild. Which state do I choose?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You should pick the state you live in when completing the application.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 16 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Can I borrow against the cash value of my whole life policy?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, you can take a loan from the policy that is less than the cash value. Interest will accrue on all policy loans at a competitive market rate.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 17 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Do I have to pay back the money I borrowed?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You can decide when and how often to repay the loan. Any outstanding loan will be deducted when the policy’s death benefit is paid or can be deducted from the cash value if the policy is cashed in.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 18 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: The coverage amounts listed on the website are different than what my child received after I purchased the policy. 
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Correct. Each policy is underwritten on an individual basis and the illustrations highlighted on our home page represent a specific scenario. Based on the insured's age and health condition, coverage amounts and estimated cash value will vary.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 19 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: What is "underwriting?" 
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Underwriting refers to the process of issuing insurance. We evaluate the risk and the potential exposure of a potential insured. Because each policy is a set monthly amount, your premiums will not change. However, the amount of life insurance coverage the insured is offered may vary. To date, 98% of juvenile policies underwriten by Northwestern Mutual require no additional follow up.
        </div>

        <!-- Question 20 -->
        <div class="question">
          Q: Can I or my child's extended family (e.g. grandparents, aunts and uncles, god parents, etc.) contribute additional money to the polciy for a birthday, holiday, or other reason?"
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, up to a certain limit per each policy per year. We are currently working on a streamlined way to allow individuals to contribute to the policy's equity (i.e. cash value) portion. Today, you must contact the Northwestern Mutual Financial Rep assigned to your account and mail a check to them for processing.
